                    This is a case study I did as the interview for <a href="https://ucomp.net/">Urban Complexity Lab</a> I later worked for. The corresponding jupyter notebook with full discussion can be found <a href="https://github.com/hhongjiang/hhongjiang.github.io/blob/master/trajectory-clustering/display/trajectory_clustering_challenge_solution.ipynb">here</a>.<br/>
                    <header><h2>Task</h2></header>
                    In the question <a href="https://github.com/hhongjiang/hhongjiang.github.io/blob/master/trajectory-clustering/display/README.md">description</a>, candidates are required to finish the following tasks on the given raw GPS trajectory dataset:<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I. Preprocess and apply uniform timescale (linear interpolation to create checkpoints). <br/>
                    II. Test K-means clustering on the data with different cluster number <i>k</i> to find the optimal one with highest Silhoutte score.<br/>
                    III. Perform Gaussian Mixture clustering using this optimal cluster number, visualize the result and detect outliers with less than 0.2% likelihood. <br/>
                    <header><h2>Challenge</h2></header>
                    The major challenge is that the <i>python-sklearn-KMeans</i> module is built for vector data, but here in this task we have tensor data {longtitude, lantitude, time}. I proposed two alternative solutions, averaged Silhoutte score and tensor flattening. To avoid the possible problems with high-dimensionality in K-means, PCA with <i>m</i> components is also used to reduce dimensionality.<br/>
                    <br/>

                    <br/>
                    <header><h2>Acceleration</h2></header>
                    To boost time performance, I used <i>sklearn.MiniBatchKMeans</i> instead of <i>KMeans</i>, which means that the most computationally costly step is conducted on only a random sample of observations as opposed to all observations. Through experiments, I found that <i>MinibatchKMeans</i> gives the same parameter result as <i>KMeans</i>, while it's much faster than <i>KMeans</i>. And <i>sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline</i> is used to make the parameter selection code more readable. <br/>
                    <header><h2>Limitation</h2></header>
                    I also discussed the limitation of the designated appoarches in this challenge. First of all, K-means doesn't consider uncertainty. Secondly, K-Means places a circle (or hyper-spehere at high dimension) at the center of each cluster. But sometimes clusters in real-world data are not circular, thus applying K-means directly might result in a poor fit. In the meantime, GMM is capable of finding a smooth Gaussian model rather than a hard-edged sphere.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Additionally, In this task we basicly rely on Euclidean distances to measure the similarity. However, this method strictly calculate the distance in each checkpoints. Thus it's very sensitive to noise. <br/>
                    <header><h2>Alternatives</h2></header>
                    More reasonale choices include:<br/>
                    <br/>
                    - Partiion trajectories into sub-trajecotries, and each of them is represented by a Minimum Bounding Rectangle(MBR), which is an expression of the maximum extents of a 2-dimensional object. The query processing is then based on these MBRs, instead of scanning data elements of an entire trajectory.(Lee S, Chun S, Kim D, et al.,2000)<br/>
                    - Longest common sub-sequence, LCSS.(M. Vlachos, G. Kollios, and D. Gunopulos,2002)<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Finally, the result of outlier detection by ranking the Gaussian Mixture Model likelihood is shown below:<br/>
